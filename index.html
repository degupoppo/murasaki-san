<!--- What's This? --->

<h3 id="whats_this">What's This? &#127808;</h3>

<p>
<b>House of Murasaki-san</b> is a dApp game built on Astar Network. This fully on-chain game has a relaxed pace with low transactions and can be classified as <b>an idle game</b> or <b>a pet simulation caring game</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="house.html?summoner=1">Demo Preview</a></b> is available for everyone. Meet developer's Murasaki-san and try <b>Feeding</b> them :)<br>
</p>

<br>

<details>
<summary>What's the Murasaki-san...?</summary>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, when I asked a friend to "create an original character that doesn't exist anywhere else," Murasaki-san was born on the edge of our sketchbook. As you may guess, the name Murasaki-san is quite unusual; Murasaki-san means "Mr. Purple" in Japanese. My friend first painted this little character purple so we could only call it murasaki-san and we finally ended up naming it "Murasaki-san", even though I think it's actually a little pink ;)<br>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why we started creating on a game to move, take care of, and grow our Murasaki-san. It was just two weeks after the Astar Network launched and we wanted to build something fun on Astar chain. After about a year of development period, we are happy to launch our product on the Astar Network :)<br>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers to Astar and Murasaki-san.<br>
<img src="src/icon/murasakisan_02.png" width="96" height="96">&lt;&nbsp;cheers!

<!--- Concept --->

<h3 id="concept">The Main Concept &#127799;</h3>
<p>
Murasaki-san is <b>the virtual pet</b> that lives in your Astar EVM wallet. Murasaki-san token is Soulbound token (SBT), not an NFT. <b>Only one Murasaki-san can live in a single wallet.</b>
</p>
<p>
As time passes, Murasaki-san becomes hungry and lonely. As you attend to their needs by feeding and grooming them, they will gradually grow. By crafting various items together with your Murasaki-san, your House will become more vibrant and lively. Your Murasaki-san may even make a new friend along the way.
</p>
<p>
Murasaki-san and House of Murasaki-san take a long long time to grow. Please take it easy and watch over them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Motivation:</b>
</p>
<p>
Our main motivations for developing this project are:<br>
<font color="#E12E7D">
<ul>
<li>To offer a pet token that can be nurtured and grown through care.
<li>To create a fully on-chain, serverless game with minimal transactions.<br>
<li>To provide a more enjoyable experience for Astar wallet owners.<br>
<li>Above all, to enjoy building and learning about Web3 ourselves.<br>
</ul>
</font>
</p>

<br>

<b>In summary:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure to <u>feed your Murasaki-san twice a day</u> and <u>groom them at least once every three days</u> to keep them healthy and happy :)
</p>

<br>


<!--- Cost --->

<h3 id="cost">Cost to Play &#x1f4b0;</h3>

<p>
<u><i>Trial Fee:</i> <b>*FREE*</b></u><br>
After trial, <u><i>Starting Fee</i>: <b>200 $ASTR <img src="src/png/coin_color_ASTR.png" width="24" height="24"></u></b>
</p>

<p>
<b>All you need for a trial of the game is a small gas fee.</b> Please feel free to try it out. If you enjoy the game, you can begin the main gameplay by paying the starting fee.<br>
</p>

<p>
The trial period comes with the following limitations:<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Level cap is set at 4.
<li>Item crafting cap is set at 3.
<li>Resouse correcting cap is set at 3000.
<li>The Marketplace is unavailable.
</ul>

<p>
It usually takes about 5-7 days of play time to reach these limits. Once the trial period is over, you can continue playing the game with no restrictions. <b>All the status and NFTs you acquired during the trial period will be carried over to the main gameplay.</b> The starting fee will gradually increase as the game economy grows. (For example, an expected 3% inflation after a month, which would be 206 $ASTR)<br>
</p>

<p>
Aside from <b><a href="#staking">the Dapps Staking Bonus</a></b>, we have not implemented any billing system that would impose additional costs affecting gameplay. If you want to buy or sell item NFTs on the Marketplace, you will need some $ASTR.
</p>

<br>


<!--- Attention --->

<h3 id="attention">Attentions &#x1F6A8;</h3>

<ul>
<li>Murasaki-san is a <b>SBT</b>, not a NFT, so you can <b>only summon once per wallet</b>, and you <b>cannot transfer or sell it.</b> On the other hand, you can buy and sell crafted item NFTs.
<li>If you neglect to take care of your Murasaki-san for a long time (<b>about a month</b>), Murasaki-san will become petrified, and you will need some <b>additional cost</b> to cure.
<li><b>Botting play using multi-wallets is profibited</b>. You will be penalized for violating the <b><a href="#tos">anti-bot policy</a></b>.
</ul>

<br>


<!--- Staking Bonus --->

<h3 id="staking">Dapps Staking Bonus! &#x1f389;</h3>

<p>
<b><font color="blue">--- We have not applied for Builder's Program yet ---<br>
--- These bonuses might be active in the future ---</font></b>
</p>

<font color="darkgray">

<p>
There are <b>in-game bonuses</b> depending on your dapps staking amount for this project.<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Get an <b>extra presentbox</b> every interval period. The higher the staking amount, the shorter the interval until the next gift.<br>
<li>Some items <b>change the picture or animation</b> according to your staking amount. Observe carefully, or spoiled below.<br>
</ul>

<p>
The Murasaki-san living in the EVM wallet (Astar EVM address) linked with the Polkadot.js wallet (Astar Native address) that is staking on the House of Murasaki-san on the dapps staking can receive the above bonuses. You can link your Astar Native address and Astar EVM address on <b><a href="https://astarpass.astar.network/">AstarPass</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
Participation in dapps staking benefits both the individual and the product as a whole. Actually, 90% of staking rewards are spent on maintaining the product (see below for details; <b><a href="#economy">economy design</a></b>).
</p>

</font>

<br>


<!--- Market --->

<h3 id="market">Item Marketplace &#x1f30f;</h3>

<p>
Item and fluffy NFTs can be bought and be listed to sell on the <b><a href="market.html">Marketplace</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
Item NFTs listed in the marketplace will be moved out of your house and will no longer have any effects while listed. Item NFTs purchased from the marketplace are immediately moved to your wallet and displayed in your house.
</p>

<p>
<b>Marketplace Rules:</b><br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Platform fee: <b>5%</b>.<br>
<li>Token used for trading: <b>$ASTR</b>.<br>
<li>Minimum listing price: <b>1.00</b> $ASTR.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Attention:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only wallets posessing an active Murasaki-san can use the Marketplace.
</p>

<br>


<!--- Tips --->

<h3 id="tips">And Then &#x1f4ac;</h3>

<p>
Here are some gameplay tips:
</p>

<ul>
<li>At the time of leveling up, Murasaki-san's status points will increase depending on their behavior. For example, if your Murasaki-san spend more time mining, their strength will increase.
<li>The amount of EXP points gained by grooming depends on the amount of time your Murasaki-san did not work. This means that if you give your Murasaki-san a break from work, grooming will provide a lot of EXP points and help them level up faster.
<li>If you leave your Murasaki-san unattended for an extended period (aboun a month), they will become deeply disappointed and turn into stone. Once petrified, your Murasaki-san will be unable to do anything. To cure petrification, you will need to play an additional cost (currently set at the same price as the starting fee).
<li>If you want to reset the positions of items in your house, click:&nbsp;
<button onclick="reset_item_position();">Reset Potision</button>
</ul>

<li>If you have more than two items with the same name and rarity, the second and subsequent items will only provide an additional status boost of 0.1x.
<li>You can mainly obtain common items by completing crafting, and occasionally, if you're lucky, you may receive uncommon items. However, rare items are never minted by crafting.
<li>To upgrade an item from a lower rarity to a higher rarity, you need to burn three items with the same name and rarity. For instance, you can burn three common violins to obtain one uncommon violin.
<li>To upgrade from common to uncommon, 200 coins and 200 leaves are needed. To upgrade from uncommon to rare, 400 coins and 400 leaves are needed. Upgrading is completed immediately and does not require any crafting time.

<p>
<b><font color="blue">--- We have not applied for Builder's Program yet ---<br>
--- The strategy of Buyback system could be changed ---</font></b>
</p>

<font color="darkgray">

<p>
<b>Don't expect too much.<br></b>
We will NOT issue our own tokens that can be pumped and dumped.
</p>

<p>
Based on market principles, item NFT may or may not be priced high. Sometimes it may sell for a high price on the marketplace. But we think these are always temporary.
</p>

<p>
We think playing games only to earn money is kind of a pain. But we also understand it is fun to realize that the NFTs you own have some value.
</p>

<p>
To improve on this goal, we have devised a buyback system. Half of the mint cost is immediately sent to the buyback vault, which buys item NFTs for a fixed amount at any time. This minimum price is by no means a high amount, but will never fall, and will rise little by little as the game economy expands.
</p>

<p>
It may be difficult to make money using the Buyback System, but it will prove that the NFTs we have are not worthless.

</p>

<br>


<!--- Future Plan --->

<h3 id="future">Future Plan &#9203;</h3>

<p>
<b>Just after launch:</b>
</p>

<p>
Our priority is to control inflation rate and keep the game going.<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixing bugs.
<li>Improving UI details.
<li>Correcting typo and misspelling.
<li>Controling inflation rate of buyback system.
</ul>

<p>
<b>After that:</b>
</p>

<p>
The project will move to the next season in a couple of years.<br>
</p>

<p>
It takes at least about <b>two years</b> for House of Murasaki-san to reach maximum growth. Over this two years, we plan to create the next product which uses the statuses of each Murasaki-san. Since Astar Network supports both EVM and WASM, so we plan to use Rust to create our next product on WASM, and interacting with House of Murasaki-san on EVM via XVM (Well, the coder is enjoying learning Rust & ink! now).<br>
</p>

<p>
The concept of the next product is still undecided yet, but we would like to make a work related to the travel. Actually, the last items Murasaki-san can craft are related to travel.
</p>

<p>
One day, a grown your Murasaki-san may set off on a journey with their friends from your house.
</p>

<p>
<b>Abount security:</b><br>
</p>

<p>
All parameters and status of NFTs and SBTs in this project are recorded on Astar chain. Some solidity codes, which are only allowed to be used by the administrator wallet, have a mechanism that can be used to rewrite user states, but at this time we believe it is necessary for game balance adjustment, bug fixes, contract upgrades, and anti-bots.
</p>

<p>
These permissions are only granted to the following administrator wallet:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0x6655B97171c8FA7dF052D95230951E80c5cB7e15"><b><font color="blue" size="-0.5">0x6655B97171c8FA7dF052D95230951E80c5cB7e15</font></b></a>
</p>

<p>
After this product is sufficiently stable, we plan to gradually renounce ownership of each contract.
</p>

<br>
