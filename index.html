<!--- What's This? --->

<h3 id="whats_this">What's This? &#127808;</h3>

<p>
<b>House of Murasaki-san</b> is a dApps game built on Astar Network. This fully on-chain game has a relaxed pace with low transactions and can be classified as <b>an idle game</b> or <b>a pet simulation caring game</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="house.html?summoner=1">Demo Preview</a></b> is available for everyone. Meet developer's Murasaki-san and try <b>Feeding</b> them :)<br>
</p>

<p>
This product can be used accross multiple platforms. You can play the game using EVM-compatible web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, etc., on Windows or macOS with the Metamask plugin, or using the Brave browser on iOS or Android smartphones.
</p>

<summary>What's the Murasaki-san...?</summary>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, when I asked a friend to "create an original character that doesn't exist anywhere else," Murasaki-san was born on the edge of our sketchbook. As you may guess, the name Murasaki-san is quite unusual; Murasaki-san means "Mr. Purple" in Japanese. My friend first painted this little character purple so we could only call it murasaki-san and we finally ended up naming it "Murasaki-san", even though I think it's actually a little pink ;)<br>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why we started creating on a game to move, take care of, and grow our Murasaki-san. It was just two weeks after the Astar Network launched and we wanted to build something fun on Astar chain. After about a year of development period, we are happy to launch our product on the Astar Network :)<br>
</p>
<p class="textMiddle">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers to Astar and Murasaki-san.<br>
<img src="src/icon/murasakisan_02.png" width="96" height="96" class="textMiddle">&lt;&nbsp;cheers!

<!--- Concept --->

<h3 id="concept">The Main Concept &#127800;</h3>
<p>
Murasaki-san is <b>the virtual pet</b> that lives in your Astar EVM wallet. Murasaki-san is a Soulbound token (SBT), not an NFT. <b>Only one Murasaki-san can live in a single wallet.</b>
</p>
<p>
As time passes, Murasaki-san becomes hungry and lonely. As you attend to their needs by feeding and grooming them, they will gradually grow. By crafting various items together with your Murasaki-san, your House will become more vibrant and lively. Your Murasaki-san may even make a new friend along the way.
</p>
<p>
Murasaki-san and House of Murasaki-san take a long long time to grow. Please take it easy and watch over them.
</p>
<p>
<b>Motivation:</b>
</p>
<p>
Our main motivations for developing this project are:<br>
<font color="#E12E7D">
<ul>
<li>To offer a pet token that can be nurtured and grown through care.
<li>To create a fully on-chain, serverless game with minimal transactions.<br>
<li>To provide a more enjoyable experience for Astar wallet owners.<br>
<li>Above all, to enjoy building and learning about Web3 ourselves.<br>
</ul>
</font>
</p>

<br>

</p>

<br>


<!--- Cost --->

<h3 id="cost">Cost to Play &#x1f4b0;</h3>

<p>
<u><i>Trial Fee:</i> <b>*FREE*</b></u><br>
After trial, <u><i>Starting Fee</i>: <b>500 $ASTR <img src="src/png/coin_color_ASTR.png" width="24" height="24"></u></b>
</p>

<p>
<b>All you need for a trial of the game is a small gas fee.</b> Please feel free to try it out. If you enjoy the game, you can begin the main gameplay by paying the starting fee.<br>
</p>

<p>
The trial period comes with the following limitations:<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Level cap is set at 4.
<li>Item crafting cap is set at 3.
<li>Resouse correcting cap is set at 3000.
<li>The Marketplace is unavailable.
</ul>

<p>
It usually takes about 5-7 days of play time to reach these limits. Once the trial period is over, you can continue playing the game with no restrictions. <b>All the status and NFTs you acquired during the trial period will be carried over to the main gameplay.</b> The starting fee will gradually increase as the game economy grows. (For example, an expected 3% inflation after a month, which would be 515 $ASTR)<br>
</p>

<p>
Aside from <b><a href="#staking">the Dapps Staking Bonus</a></b>, we have not implemented any billing system that would impose additional costs affecting gameplay. If you want to buy or sell item NFTs on the Marketplace, you will need some $ASTR.
</p>

<br>


<!--- Attention --->

<h3 id="attention">Attentions &#127775;</h3>

<p>
Before starting the game, please take note of the following precautions:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Murasaki-san is a <b>SBT</b>, not a NFT, so you can <b>only summon once per wallet</b>, and you <b>cannot transfer or sell it.</b> On the other hand, you can buy and sell crafted item NFTs.
<li>This project does not have plans for issuing a proprietary token. The coins and leaves obtained within the game are only usable within the game and do not follow the ERC-20 standard. $ASTR token is used for buying and selling of NFTs.
<li>If you neglect to take care of your Murasaki-san for a long time (<b>about a month</b>), Murasaki-san will become petrified, and you will need some <b>additional cost</b> to cure.
<li><b>Botting play using multi-wallets is profibited</b>. You will be penalized for violating the <b><a href="#tos">anti-bot policy</a></b>.
</ul>

<br>


<!--- Staking Bonus --->

<h3 id="staking">Dapps Staking Bonus! &#x1f973;</h3>

<p>
<b><font color="blue">--- We have not applied for Builder's Program yet ---<br>
--- These bonuses might be active in the future ---</font></b>
</p>

<font color="darkgray">

<p>
There are <b>in-game bonuses</b> depending on your dapps staking amount for this project.<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Get an <b>extra presentbox</b> every interval period. The higher the staking amount, the shorter the interval until the next gift.<br>
<li>Some items <b>change the picture or animation</b> according to your staking amount. Observe carefully, or spoiled below.<br>
</ul>

<p>
The Murasaki-san living in the EVM wallet (Astar EVM address) linked with the Polkadot.js wallet (Astar Native address) that is staking on the House of Murasaki-san on the dapps staking can receive the above bonuses. You can link your Astar Native address and Astar EVM address on <b><a href="https://astarpass.astar.network/">AstarPass</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
Participation in dapps staking benefits both the individual and the product as a whole. Actually, 90% of staking rewards are spent on maintaining the product (see below for details; <b><a href="#economy">economy design</a></b>).
</p>

</font>

<br>


<!--- Market --->

<h3 id="market">Item Marketplace &#x1f6d2;</h3>

<p>
Item and fluffy NFTs can be bought and be listed to sell on the <b><a href="market.html">Marketplace</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
Item NFTs listed in the marketplace will be moved out of your house and will no longer have any effects while listed. Item NFTs purchased from the marketplace are immediately moved to your wallet and displayed in your house.
</p>

<p>
<b>Currency and Fees:</b><br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Token used for trading: <b>$ASTR</b>.<br>
<li>Platform fee: <b>5%</b>.<br>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Market Rules:</b><br>
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Wallets that have an active Murasaki-san SBT</b> can use this marketplace.
<li><b>The Minimum listing price is set at the buyback price or 1.00 $ASTR</b>, whichever is higher. The buyback prices for each item can be found in <a href="buyback.html">Buyback Market</a>.
<li>Dutch auction mechanism: Items <b>listed for less than 100 $ASTR will be pre-listed using the Dutch auction mechanism</b>. The auction will start at a price of 100 $ASTR and will decrease to the listing price over a 24 hr period. The item will then remain at the listing price unless the owner unlists it.
</ul>

<br>


<!--- Tips --->

<h3 id="tips">And Then &#x1f4ac;</h3>

<p>
Here are some gameplay tips:
</p>

<ul>
<li>At the time of leveling up, Murasaki-san's status points will increase depending on their behavior. For example, if your Murasaki-san spend more time mining, their strength will increase.
<li>The amount of EXP points gained by grooming depends on the amount of time your Murasaki-san did not work. This means that if you give your Murasaki-san a break from work, grooming will provide a lot of EXP points and help them level up faster.
<li>If you leave your Murasaki-san unattended for an extended period (aboun a month), they will become deeply disappointed and turn into stone. Once petrified, your Murasaki-san will be unable to do anything. To cure petrification, you will need to play an additional cost (currently set at the same price as the starting fee).
<li>If you want to reset the positions of items in your house, click:&nbsp;
<button onclick="reset_item_position();">Reset Potision</button>
</ul>

<li>You can mainly obtain common items by completing crafting, and occasionally, if you're lucky, you may receive uncommon items. However, rare items are never minted by crafting.
<li>To upgrade an item from a lower rarity to a higher rarity, you need to burn three items with the same name and rarity. For instance, you can burn three common violins to obtain one uncommon violin.
<li>To upgrade from common to uncommon, 200 coins and 200 leaves are needed. To upgrade from uncommon to rare, 400 coins and 400 leaves are needed. Upgrading is completed immediately and does not require any crafting time.

<summary>About Fluffy</summary>

<p>
Fluffy is a small housemate in your house who dreams of becomming Murasaki-san. The more fluffies that live in the house, <b>the more luck</b> your Murasaki-san will have (One fluffy score is equivalent to +0.01 LUK). You can <b>upgrade</b> your fluffy from a lower level to an upper level by burning fluffies of the same color.
</p>

<p>
<b>By opening the present boxes</b>, you will get a random color of fluffy. You can receive the present box in the following situations: <b>crafting bonus</b> (when Murasaki-san completes crafting an item, a random Murasaki-san will receive a present box), <b>cat-mail bonus</b> (when your Murasaki-san open a cat-mail, both the sender and recipient will receive a present box), <b>festival participation bonus</b> (your Murasaki-san receive a present box by voting during the Fluffy Festival. The first voter and the last voter can receive an additional one), <b>dApps staking bonus</b> (depending on your dapps staking amount, you can receive fluffy once every 7-30 days).

<summary>About Flower Wreath and Exp Boost</summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="src/png/item_wreath.png" width="80" height="80" class="textMiddle">

<p>
By crafting and placing a flower wreath in the house, it activates <b>an exp boost bonus that reflects the on-chain activity of the players's wallet</b>. The exp boost rate increases based on the number of token types owned in the wallet, the number of NFT types owned in the wallet, and the dApps staking amount for this project.
</p>

<p>
This is an experimental initiative aimed at increasing the on-chain activity of the Astar wallet and fostering interaction between projects on the Astar chain. While the bonus values obtained may not be significant, they are a valuable element as there are few other means to increase exp efficiency. Wallets with high activity on Astar Network will receive stronger bonuses.
</p>

<b>The step of Staking amount:</b> 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, 128000, >128000 $ASTR
</p>

<p>
If a player has one or more tokens/NFTs of a specific type in the wallet, the player will receive an exp boost bonus of +0.1% for each of that type. In token category, the boost bonus is valid as long as the player holds more than zero tokens (it does not have to be in denominations of 1 currency, for example, 1 $BTC). In NFT category, having two ore more NFTs from the same project does not increase the exp boost bonus. In staking category, by staking an amount equal or greater than each step, the player can increase the bonus by an additional +0.1% per step. The exp boost bonus values do not exceed +1% in each category (maximum +1% for tokens, maximum +1% for NFTs, maximum +1% for staking).
</p>

<p>
The eligible types of tokens and NFTs may be subject to additions and modifications in the future. Additionally, when this project issues its own original NFTs, holding them will provide an exp boost bonus as a separate category.

<details><summary>About Cat-Mail</summary>

<img src="src/png/cat_sitting.png" width="96" height="96" class="textMiddle">

<p>
Cat-mail is one of <b>the mechanisms to obtain present boxes</b>. It is unlocked when you have the <b>Cat Cushion</b><img src="src/png/item_cushion.png" width="40" height="40" class="textMiddle">in your house.
</p>
<p>
By crafting cat-mail<img src="src/icon/mail.png" width="40" height="40" class="textMiddle">(which requires a cost of 100 coins and 100 leaves) and having it in your house, you can send cat-mail <b>to a random recipient</b> by clicking on your cat. A cat with the mail will appear in the recipient's house, and the recipient can click to open the mail. <b>When the cat-mail is opened, present boxes are sent to both the sender and the recipient</b>.
</p>
<p>
Once a cat has sent out with mail, it becomes tired and will sleep even when it returns to your house. After <b>7 days</b> from the sending date, your cat will wake up and be able to send mail again.
</p>
<p>
The cat tries to visit a well-cared Murasaki-san (<b><img src="src/png/icon_system_satiety.png" width="25" height="25">satiety >30% and <img src="src/png/icon_system_happy.png" width="25" height="25">happy >30%</b>). If a suitable Murasaki-san is not found, the cat may occasionally get lost, but it will safely return your house after 7 days.
</p>
<p>
Only one cat can visit at a time in the house, and two cats will not visit the same house (although your cat and a visiting cat from someone else can be in the your house at the same time).
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="src/icon/cat_sleeping.png" width="72" height="72">

<p>
Having the cat cushion is necessary to send cat-mail, but <b>even if you don't have a cat cushion, someone's cat may visit your house</b>. Visiting cats will stay in your house for a maximum of 7 days. Please make sure to open the cat-mail without missing it.

<summary>Contracts</summary>
<p>
The project is currently implemented as a complex set of contracts consisting of one NFT contract, two SBT contracts, five storage contracts, seven function contracts, and several add-on contracts.
</p>

<p>
Here is an overview of each contract:
</p>

<p class="lineHeight8">
<img width="700" src="src/png/fig_contracts.png" />
<font size="-2">
<b>Abbreviations:</b> mfs:Murasaki_Function_Share, mfcc:Murasaki_Function_Crafting_Codex, ma:Murasaki_Address, mp:Murasaki_Parameter, mffg:Murasaki_Function_Feeding_and_Grooming, mfmf:Murasaki_Function_Mining_and_Farming, mfsl:Murasaki_Function_Summon_and_Levelup, mmp:Murasaki_Music_Practice, mfc1:Murasaki_Function_Crafting1, mfc2:Murasaki_Function_Crafting2, mfn:Murasaki_Function_name, mss:Murasaki_Storage_Score, ms:Murasaki_Storage, msn:Murasaki_Storage_Nui, mm:Murasaki_Main, mc:Murasaki_Craft, mn:Murasaki_Name, market:Murasaki_Market_Item, mav:Murasaki_Achievement, uri:Murasaki_tokenURI, mml:Murasaki_Mail, md:Murasaki_Dice, mst:Murasaki_Staking, ll:Murasaki_Lootlike, ff:Fluffy_Festival, st:Strolling, info:Murasaki_Info, Murasaki:Murasakisan
</font>
</p>

<p>
The solidity code for each contract can be referenced <a href="src/solidity/murasaki_all.sol">here</a>. The latest address of each contract is storaged in the <a href="https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0x176C5B3582C8C851B7aF4efac618fb17901cDDf1">Murasaki_Address</a> contract.
</p>

<p>
All contracts are linked and managed through the summoner ID assigned to the Murasaki-san SBT.
Function contracts are individually replaceable, and bug fixes, balance adjustments, and other game upgrades can be implemented by replacing or updating them. Add-on contracts are created as needed when adding new features for the gameplay.
</p>

<p>
Due to the complexity of the project's contract system, a viewer contract has been prepared to provide convenient access to major parameters of Murasaki-san. The viewer contract follows the concept of web3 and is available for anyone to use without any permissions. It is also designed to be referenced in the future endeavors, such as the upcomming next product that we plan to create using WASM. For more detailed information about the viewer contract, please refer to the "<a href="#developer">For the Developers</a>" session.

<!---### buyback --->

<details>

<summary>Buyback Treasury</summary>

<p>
The buyback system was designed to ensure that players can sell the NFTs of this project to the treasury at a fixed price at any time, thus constantly guaranteeing the asset value of the NFTs in this project.
</p>

<p>
The developers believe that continuing to play the game solely for monetary gain can be somewhat burdensome. Lucky players may be able to sell their earned NFTs at a high price and make some profits. However, this can create temporary and sometimes harmful bubbles, disadvantaging unlucky players or latecomers.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the developers also understand the enjoyment of having NFTs with asset value.
</p>

<p>
To improve on this goal, the developers have implemented an automated buyback system in this project. Approximately half of the starting fee paid by the player is immediately sent to the buyback treasury. Players can receive a fixed-price buyback at any time by burning the NFTs of this project. Item NFTs that require more resources to craft in the game are assigned higher buyback prices. Additionally, the buyback prices set for each item gradually increase over time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Buyback price calculation:</b><br>
<font size="-0.5">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price = Resource / 1074560 * AmountPerPlayer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resouce = [The sum of coins and leaves required for crafting]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AmountPerPlayer = [Set at 45% of the starting price and increasing]
</font>
</p>

<p>
In other words, the minimum price of each NFTs in this project is determined, and this minimum price (buyback price) never decreases but always increase over time. With each acquisition of NFTs through ongoing gameplay, the player's asset value increases steadily, and it also continues to increase by holding the NFTs. Since the buyback treasury always holds enough to buyback all items from all players, there will never be a situation where the reasury runs out and later players cannot receive buybacks.
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img width="400" src="src/png/fig_price.png" />
<figcaption>
The price trend model secured by the buyback system for NFTs. The rate of increase is not very high, but the price never decreases and gradually rises over time.
</figcaption>
</center>
</p>

<p>
Regarding the rate of increase in the buyback price, developers plan to tradually raise it, but developers don't have specific calculations for the appropriate rate of increase at the moment. The buyback price will increase faster as additional funds flow into this project (see the Economy Details session). As an example, developers are considering a rate of increase of approximately 1-3% per month. Additionally, if there are many dropout players who have stopped playing the game, the buyback prices for players who continue to play will be more likely to increase (the buyback tokens allocated for dropout players will be reallocated to the remaining players). On the other hand, interestingly, a large influx of new players is expected to make it difficult to increase the buyback price (as the buyback price is equivalent ot the new inflow value divided by the total active players).
</p>

<p>
Of course, all players have the option to sell NFTs on the marketplace insted of burning them in the buyback system. It is likely that players can sell NFTs at higher prices on the marketplace compared to buyback price. The buyback system can be seen as a defensive mechanism to prevent the price of NFTs from plummeting in case there are no buyers.
</p>

<p>
This buyback system is somewhat experimental, and its acceptance by players will only be known after it has been operational for a while. The developers will continuously explore areas for improvement.

<!--- Astar --->

<h3 id="astar">Why Astar? <img src="src/png/coin_color_ASTR.png" width="32" height="32"></h3>

<p>
Astar is a highly promising and excellent blockchain. The developers have chosen Astar as the launch platform for this project primarily for the following reasons:
</p>

<p>
<b>dApps Staking:</b><br>
The developers can focus on the project's development without worrying about financial sustainability, if their project were adopted for dapps staking. On the player's side, they can support the project financially without exposing their assets to hacking risks or depleting them by excessive purchases of the project's NFTs or tokens. In this project, players engaging in dapps staking are rewarded with in-game incentives, allowing both the project and players to benefit from low-risk profit. In other words, players who are fond of this project and want to play more efficiently have an incentive to stake more assets in dApps staking. This incentivizes the project's developers strive to make development that encourage players to stake more funds in dApps staking. To our knowledge, Astar Network is the first to advocate for this excellent mechanism.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM):</b><br>
By utilizing XVM, the developers will have the freedom to seamlessly interoperate between EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) contracts and WASM (WebAssembly) contracts, allowing for future compatibility. Currently, EVM benefits from excellent libraries and development knowledge. However, in the near future, within a few years, WASM is expected to become a core technology in Web3. We believe that Astar chain, with the availability of XVM, is the only platform that enables a seamless shift of development resources from EVM to WASM. One of our main goals is to constantly keep up with the latest technologies in web3. For our next season project, we aim to leverage the assets of this EVM-based project while developing on a WASM basis, and Astar Network is the only platform that allows for such development possibilities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Low Gas Fee:</b><br>
When developing a fully on-chain game, the low cost of gas fee is extremely important. Currently, Astar chain maintains very low gas fees, allowing players to engage in gameplay with minimal concerns about gas costs, even for transactions involving relatively complex operations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Top of the Polkadot Parachains:</b><br>
We strongly believe in the future interoperability brought by Polkadot and parachains. Based on the three reasons mentioned above, we are confident that Astar Network is currently the most suitable environment for project development among the parachains of Polkadot.
</p>

<p>
Cheers to Astar :)

<h3 id="developer">For the Developers &#128736;</h3>

<p>
We have prepared a contract that enables anyone to access information about Murasaki-san in this project. Although the contracts in this project are complex, you can access the major information using this contract. Consistent with web3 principles, the information within this contract is free to use without requiring any permissions.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Contract Address:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="blue" size="-1"><a href="https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0x31d69b5125ce419a2948a58b7Aa0883D57c06850">0x31d69b5125ce419a2948a58b7Aa0883D57c06850</a></font></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Contract ABI:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href="src/solidity/abi_Murasakisan.json">abi_Murasakisan.json</a></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Contract interface:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><a href="src/solidity/IMurasakisan.sol">IMurasakisan.sol</a></b><br>
</p>

<p>
With this contract, you can obtain status values of user's Murasaki-san such as Level, Age, Name, STR, present satiety, score, total_leaves_farmed, total_item_crafted, and more, using user's wallet address. This contract also meets the criteria for ERC165 and ERC721 standards and is compatible to Metamask etc, although transfers are not allowed since the Murasaki-san tokens are SBT.<br>
</p>

<p>
This contract enables you to integrate Murasaki-san's information into your web pages or contracts. For example, you can display the name and the other status of the Murasaki-san associated with a connected wallet on your web page.
</p>

<p>
<div id="output_murasakiInfo">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example:&nbsp;
    <button style="height:28px;font-size:80%" onclick="show_murasakiInfo();">
        &nbsp;<b>Hello Murasaki-san!</b>&nbsp;
    </button>
</div>
</p>

<p>
The example JavaScript code used <a href="src/js/murasakiInfo.txt">can be found here.</a> Other informations available in the contract can be found in <a href="src/solidity/IMurasaki_Info_from_wallet.sol">the interface file</a> described above.

<p>
Please feel free to use it :)
</p>

<!--- Future Plan --->

<h3 id="future">Future Plan &#9203;</h3>

<p>
<b>Just after launch:</b>
</p>

<p>
Our priority is to control inflation rate and keep the game going.<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixing bugs.
<li>Improving UI details.
<li>Correcting typo and misspelling.
<li>Controling inflation rate of buyback system.
</ul>

<p>
<b>After that:</b>
</p>

<p>
The project will move to the next season in a couple of years.<br>
</p>

<p>
It takes at least about <b>two years</b> for House of Murasaki-san to reach maximum growth. Over this two years, we plan to create the next product which uses the information of <a href="#developer">the Murasakisan contract</a> descrived above. Since Astar Network supports both EVM and WASM, so we plan to use Rust to create our next product on WASM, and interacting with House of Murasaki-san on EVM via XVM (Well, the coder is enjoying learning Rust & ink! now).<br>
</p>

<p>
The concept of the next product is still undecided yet, but we would like to make a work related to the travel. Actually, the last items Murasaki-san can craft are related to travel.
</p>

<p>
One day, a grown your Murasaki-san may set off on a journey with their friends from your house.
</p>

<p>
<b>Abount security:</b><br>
</p>

<p>
All parameters and status of NFTs and SBTs in this project are recorded on Astar chain. Some solidity codes, which are only allowed to be used by the administrator wallet, have a mechanism that can be used to rewrite user states, but at this time we believe it is necessary for game balance adjustment, bug fixes, contract upgrades, and anti-bots.
</p>

<p>
These permissions are only granted to the following administrator wallet:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0x6655B97171c8FA7dF052D95230951E80c5cB7e15"><b><font color="blue" size="-0.5">0x6655B97171c8FA7dF052D95230951E80c5cB7e15</font></b></a>
</p>

<p>
After this product is sufficiently stable, we plan to gradually renounce ownership of each contract.
</p>
