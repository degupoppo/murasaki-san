<!--- What's This? --->

<h3 id="whats_this">What's This? &#127808;</h3>

<p>
<b>House of Murasaki-san</b> is a dApp game built on Astar Network (Substrate EVM). This fully on-chain game has a relaxed pace with low transactions and can be classified as <b>an idle game</b> or <b>a pet caring game</b>.<br>
</p>

<p>
<button style="font-size:80%; font-weight: bold; background-color:#FF4F6F;" onclick="location.href='house.html?summoner=999999999';">Demo Preview</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;is available to everyone. Take a peek into the developer's murasaki-san! (no wallet connection or network change is required)<br>
</p>

<p>
This product can be used accross multiple platforms. You can play the game using EVM-compatible web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, etc., on Windows or macOS with the Metamask plugin, or using the Brave browser on iOS or Android smartphones. It is necessary for your wallet to be connected to RPC server of the Astar Substrate EVM and have $ASTR tokens for gas fees.
</p>

<br>

<details>
<summary>What's the Murasaki-san...?</summary>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, when I asked a friend to "create an original character that doesn't exist anywhere else," Murasaki-san was born on the edge of our sketchbook. As you may guess, the name Murasaki-san is quite unusual; Murasaki-san means "Mr. Purple" in Japanese. My friend first painted this little character purple so we could only call it murasaki-san and we finally ended up naming it "Murasaki-san", even though I think it's actually a little pink ;)<br>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why we started creating on a game to move, take care of, and grow our Murasaki-san. It was just two weeks after the Astar Network launched and we wanted to build something fun on Astar chain. After about a year of development period, we are happy to launch our product on the Astar Network :)<br>
</p>
<p class="textMiddle">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers to Astar and Murasaki-san.<br>

<!--- Concept --->

<h3 id="concept">The Main Concept &#127800;</h3>

<p>
Murasaki-san is <b>the virtual pet</b> that lives in your Astar EVM wallet. Murasaki-san is a Soulbound token (SBT), not an NFT. <b>Only one Murasaki-san can live in a single wallet.</b>
</p>

<p>
As time passes, Murasaki-san becomes hungry and lonely. As you attend to their needs by feeding and grooming them, they will gradually grow. By crafting various items together with your Murasaki-san, your House will become more vibrant and lively. Your Murasaki-san may even make a new friend along the way.
</p>

<p>
Murasaki-san and House of Murasaki-san take a long long time to grow. Please take it easy and watch over them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Motivation:</b>
</p>

<p>
Our main motivations for developing this project are:<br>
<font color="#E12E7D">
<ul>
<li>To offer a pet token that can be nurtured and grown through care.
<li>To create a fully on-chain, serverless game with minimal transactions.<br>
<li>To provide a more enjoyable experience for Astar wallet owners.<br>
<li>Above all, to enjoy building and learning about Web3 ourselves.<br>
</ul>
</font>
</p>

<p>

And a little more about our purpose:<br>

<details>
<summary>What we want to achieve in this project:</summary>

<p><font color="#E12E7D">
<b>A virtual pet token that resides in and lives within a wallet.</b>
</font></p>

<p>
The wallet is a crucial identifier that represents an individual in the web3 world. We thought it would be more fun to consider the wallet as a "house" and have a pet token residing in it and living within it.
</p>

<p>
To express the idea of "residing in the wallet," the Murasaki-san token was implemented as an SBT (untransfable ERC-721 token). The Murasaki-san token determines the place of birth, personality, and address of the house when it is minted, and these parameters are determined based on the wallet address, similar to <a href="https://www.lootproject.com/synthloot">Synthetic Loot by Dom Hofmann</a>. There are approximately 9,000 combinations of these patterns, and different Murasaki-san tokens with unique characteristics reside in each wallet (although these parameters currently have no direct impact on gameplay).
</p>

<p>
To express the idea of "living within the wallet," Murasaki-san's "Satiety" and "Happy" decrease over time and can be restored by the wallet owner taking care of them. Murasaki-san tokens gradually grow through the continuous care of the wallet owner, and their status values such as level and strength increase. These processes are fully on-chain, serverless, tamper-resistance, and unstoppable, and the token's status values are stored only on the blockchain.
</p>

<p>
Furniture and interior decorations are provided as NFTs, and are placed in House of Murasaki-san by owning them within the wallet. Some items reflect the state of the Astar wallet, such as a clock whose hands move based on the nonce value of the wallet, a goldfish inside a fishbowl that grows with the wallet age, a chest from which tokens owned in the wallet pop out, and a photoframe randomly displaying NFTs owned within the wallet. The more the player uses their wallet on the Astar chain, the more their wallet will be considered a lively house.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the purpose of this project is to provide a pet token that is uniquely bound to a "house" wallet and grows throught time and continuous care. This is exactly what we ourselves wanted to own, and it is our main motivation and purpose for keeping development.
</p>

<b>In summary:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure to <u>feed your Murasaki-san every day</u> and <u>groom them at least once every three days</u> to keep them healthy and happy :)
</p>

<br>


<!--- Cost --->

<h3 id="cost">Cost to Play and Trial &#x1f4b0;</h3>

<p>
<u><i>Trial Fee:</i> <b>*FREE*</b></u><br>
After trial, <u><i>Starting Fee</i>: <b>500 $ASTR <img src="src/png/coin_color_ASTR.png" width="24" height="24"></u></b>
</p>

<p>
<b>All you need for a trial of the game is some gas fees.</b> Please feel free to try it out. If you enjoy the game, you can begin the main gameplay by paying the starting fee.<br>
</p>

<p>
The trial period comes with the following limitations:<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Level cap is set at 4.
<li>Item crafting cap is set at 3.
<li>Resouse correcting cap is set at 3000.
<li>The Marketplace is unavailable.
</ul>

<p>
It usually takes about 5-7 days of play time to reach these limits. Once the trial period is over, you can continue playing the game with no restrictions. <b>All the status and NFTs you acquired during the trial period will be carried over to the main gameplay.</b> The starting fee will gradually increase as the game economy grows. (For example, an expected 3% inflation after a month, which would be 515 $ASTR)<br>
</p>

<p>
Except for <b><a href="#staking">the dApp Staking Bonus</a></b>, there is not any billing system that would impose additional costs affecting normal gameplay. When players want to buy or sell item NFTs on the Marketplace, some $ASTR will be needed. Additionally, for standard gameplay, approximately <b>0.8-1.0 $ASTR</b> of gas fees per day are required (details in the <b><a href="#detailedspecific">Gas Cost</a></b> session). 
</p>

<p>
90% of the starting fee is allocated towards expanding the ecosystem and ensuring the NFT prices. For more details, please refer to <b><a href="#detailedspecific">the Economy</a></b> section below.
</p>

<br>


<!--- dApp Staking --->

<h3 id="staking">dApp Staking Bonus! &#x1f973;</h3>

<center><p class="notice" style="width:80%;">
<b>&#127775; Attention &#127775;</b><br>
The contents described below are applicable if this project is adopted for dApp Staking on the Astar Network
</p></center>

<p>
There are <b>in-game bonuses</b> depending on your dApp staking amount for this project.<br>
</p>

<p>
<img src="src/png/item_staking.png" width="80" height="80" class="textMiddle" style="float:left; margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px">When you stake $ASTR in dApp Staking for this project, the construction of <b>a House of Gingerbread</b> will begin. <b>The more $ASTR you stake, the faster the construction will be</b>. Once the construction is complete, you will be able to mint <b>a random NFT</b>.
</p>

<p>
The Murasaki-san living in the EVM wallet (Astar EVM H160 address) linked with the Polkadot wallet (Astar Native SS58 address) that is staking on the House of Murasaki-san on the dApp staking can receive the above bonuses. You can link your Astar Native wallet and Astar EVM wallet on <b><a href="https://astarpass.astar.network/">AstarPass</a></b>.
</p>

<p>
Players can also participate in dApp Staking directly from their EVM wallets. The stake ammount for players is calculated as the sum of tokens staked by their EVM wallet and tokens staked by their Polkadot wallet linked by AstarPass.
</p>

<p>
Support for <b><a href="https://docs.astar.network/ja/docs/build/astar-beta-labs/account-unification/">Account Unification</a></b> is currently under consideration. It will be addressed after Account Unification is officially launched on Astar mainnet.
</p>

<p>
By clicking on your House of Gingerbread, you can check the staked amount and the current progress of construction. After the construction is completed, clicking on it will mint the reward NFT, and then the next construction will begin. The details of the construction efficiency and the reward NFT are explained in the <b><a href="#detailedspecific">Calculation Formulas</a></b> section.
</p>

<p>
Participation in dApp staking benefits both the player and the product as a whole. Actually, 90% of staking rewards are spent on maintaining the product (see <b><a href="#detailedspecific">Economy Details</a></b> session).

</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Wallets that have an active Murasaki-san SBT</b> can use this marketplace.
<li><b>Dutch auction mechanism</b>: Items listed for less than <b>500 $ASTR</b> will be pre-listed using the Dutch auction mechanism. The auction will start at a price of 500 $ASTR and will decrease to the listing price over a 24 hr period. The item will then remain at the listing price unless the owner unlists it.
<li><b><a href="buyback.html">Buyback Treasury</a>:</b> Players can choose to list their owned NFTs for auction on the Marketplace or burn them in the Buyback Treasury at a fixed price. The Minimum listing price is set at the buyback price or 1.00 $ASTR, whichever is higher.

<!--- Attention --->

<h3 id="attention">Attentions and Tips &#127775;</h3>

<p>
<u>Before starting the game, please take note of the following precautions:</u>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Murasaki-san is a <b>SBT</b>, not a NFT, so you can <b>only summon once per wallet</b>, and you <b>cannot transfer or sell it.</b> On the other hand, you can buy and sell crafted item NFTs.
<li>This project does not have plans for issuing a proprietary token. The coins and leaves obtained within the game are only usable within the game and do not follow the ERC-20 standard. $ASTR token is used for buying and selling of NFTs.
<li>If you neglect to take care of your Murasaki-san for a long time (<b>about a month</b>), Murasaki-san will become petrified, and you will need some <b>additional cost</b> to cure.
<li><b>Botting play using multi-wallets is profibited</b>. You will be penalized for violating the <b><a href="#tos">anti-bot policy</a></b>.
</ul>

<p>
<u>And here are some gameplay tips:</u>
</p>

<ul>
<li>At the time of leveling up, Murasaki-san's status points will increase depending on their behavior. For example, if your Murasaki-san spend more time mining, their strength will increase.
<li>The amount of EXP points gained by grooming depends on the amount of time your Murasaki-san did not work. This means that if you give your Murasaki-san a break from work, grooming will provide a lot of EXP points and help them level up faster.
<li>If you leave your Murasaki-san unattended for an extended period (aboun a month), they will become deeply disappointed and turn into stone. Once petrified, your Murasaki-san will be unable to do anything. To cure petrification, you will need to pay an additional cost (currently set at the same price as the starting fee).
</ul>

<summary>Fluffy Festival <img src="src/icon/ohana.png" width="34" height="34" class="textMiddle"></summary>

<p>
Fluffy Festival is a <b>monthly event</b> where <b>the most popular color of fluffy is determined through player on-chain voting</b>. The elected color of fluffy will receive a bonus for the following month, with their fluffy score being calculated <b>as double</b>. Players who participate in the voting will receive a <b>present box</b> as a participation reward.

<b>Nainai-san:</b> Nainai-san is a small fairy that visits the player's house during Fluffy Festival. By clicking on Nainai-san, a voting window opens where players can decide which color of fluffy to vote for. After voting, players can see the remaining block count and the current number of votes. The festival lasts for 24 hours, and once 24 hours have passed since the first vote, it concludes, and the results are determined.
</p>

<p>
<b>Candle Auction Mechanism:</b> The Candle Auction mechanism is also adopted in the crowdloan auctions on Polkadot. Once Fluffy Festival concludes, a random time interval between the start and end of the auction is selected.

<p>
<b>The Winning Fluffy:</b> The color of the fluffy elected as the winner of the Fluffy Festival receives a bonus where its fluffy score is doubled until the next festival concludes.

<details>

<summary>Pippel <img src="src/png/pippel_basic.png" width="32" height="32" class="textMiddle"></summary>

<p>
Pippel is a small flower that occasionally blooms in the House of Murasaki-san. When you are lucky enough to find Pippel, you can mint a Pippel NFT by clicking/tapping on it. <b>Pippel NFTs are held within Token Bound Account (TBA, <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551?ref=blog.thirdweb.com">ERC-6551</a>) of your Murasaki-san,</b> not in your wallet. Gathering many Pippels will increase fluffy score and raise luck of your Murasaki-san. The rarer the Pippel, the higher the score it provides.
</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="src/png/pippel_basic.png" width="64" height="64" class="textMiddle"> < pippel!

<p>
Pippel appears for <b>only 3 hours each day</b> out of the 48-hour cycle. The appearance time resets daily at 00:00 UTC. Each Pippel NFT is assigned an unique flower name and a rarity based on the flower's blooming state. There are <b>five blooming rarities: closed, opening, blossoming, blooming, and bloomed</b>, with "bloomed" being the rarest status. The names of the flowers vary daily, totaling <b>366 different flower names</b>, allocated based on the climate and birth flowers of Eastern Asia.
</p>

<p>
When you mint your first Pippel, <b>the House of Pippel</b> (flower basket, TBA of your Murasaki-san) is placed within the house. Clicking on it allows you to view your collection of Pippel NFTs and check TBA address. Gathering a large number of Pippel NFTs will make the Pippel summary increasingly lively, as they come together to create a larger picture of Pippel.
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="src/png/pippel_house.png" width="64" height="64" class="textMiddle">

<p>
The increase in luck through Pippel NFTs is quite minimal and does not significantly boost the efficiency of the game. Pippel NFTs have been implemented for the purpose of enhancing the experience of continuous gameplay. Depending on the type and rarity of the minted Pippel, unique colored Pippel summary pictures are formed for each player. Additionally, while Pippel NFTs adhere to the ERC721 standard (and ERC2665 standard), there are currently no plans to encourage or implement trading of Pippel NFTs (a trading fee of 50 $ASTR has been set).
</p>

<br>

<p>
<b>What's the Pippel...?</b><br>
<br>
One day, my friend was playing around with a text-generating AI, simulating what kind of conversations their favorites fluffy dolls would have if they suddenly started talking to each other. In this simulation, one of the fluffy dolls, a flower-loving plushie, began excitedly talking abount discovering a new flower named "Pippel."<br>
<br>
When my friend asked him through AI abount the characteristics of Pippel, it revealed that Pippel was described as a small, cute, round-shaped flower with a multitude of colorful petals that exuded a delightful fragrance, blooming in the world of fluffy dolls. Surprisingly, the word "Pippel" appeared to be a creation of the AI and the fluffy dolls' imagination at that moment (no relevant source was found through any search engine). The fluffy dolls then continued their conversation, planning to go searching for Pippel in the park.<br>
<br>
Inspired by this stroy, the coder was determined to bring Pippel to life and thus, Pippel NFTs were born. Pippel NFTs are considered as different colored petals individually, and by collecting many Pippel NFTs, unique big Pippel in various colors and sizes are formed for each player (Pippel summary picture in gameplay). It seems that Murasaki-san and the fluffies really adore this Pippel :)

<summary>Flower Wreath and Exp Boost <img src="src/png/item_wreath.png" width="32" height="32" class="textMiddle"></summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="src/png/item_wreath.png" width="80" height="80" class="textMiddle">

<p>
By crafting and placing a flower wreath in the house, it activates <b>an exp boost bonus that reflects the on-chain activity of the players's wallet</b>. The exp boost rate increases based on the number of token types owned in the wallet, the number of NFT types owned in the wallet, and the dApp staking amount for this project.
</p>

<p>
This is an experimental initiative aimed at increasing the on-chain activity of the Astar wallet and fostering interaction between projects on the Astar chain. While the bonus values obtained may not be significant, they are a valuable element as there are few other means to increase exp efficiency. Wallets with high activity on Astar Network will receive stronger bonuses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Corresponding tokens are:</b><br>
$ACA, $ASTR, $BNB, $BTC, $BUSD, $DAI, $DOT, $ETH, $GMLR, $KSM, $LAY, $MATIC, $SDN, $USDC, $USDT
</p>

<p>
<b>Corresponding NFT projects are:</b><br>
AstarDegens, CandyGirl, AstarCats, AstarPunks, HEALTHREE
</p>

<p>
<b>The step of Staking amount:</b><br>
500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000, 64000, 128000, >128000 $ASTR
</p>

<p>
If a player has one or more tokens/NFTs of a specific type in the wallet, the player will receive an exp boost bonus of +0.1% for each of that type. In token category, the boost bonus is valid as long as the player holds more than zero tokens (it does not have to be in denominations of 1 currency, for example, 1 $BTC). In NFT category, having two ore more NFTs from the same project does not increase the exp boost bonus. In staking category, by staking an amount equal or greater than each step, the player can increase the bonus by an additional +0.1% per step. The exp boost bonus values do not exceed +1% in each category (maximum +1% for tokens, maximum +1% for NFTs, maximum +1% for staking).
</p>

<p>
The eligible types of tokens and NFTs may be subject to additions and modifications in the future. Additionally, when this project issues its own original NFTs, holding them will provide an exp boost bonus as a separate category.

<p>
By crafting a Water Bottle, Murasaki-san will be able to <b>go for a stroll</b>. The strolling system is a mechanism to make friends and acquire <b>special NFTs</b> that can only be obtained outside the house.
</p>

<p>
Rules for strolling:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Before departing, decide on the <b>destination</b> (mountain, sea, or grassland), <b>companion</b> (Mr.Astar, Ms.Ether, or Dr.Bitco) and <b>drink</b> (Water, Coffee, Tea, or Juice). Murasaki-san walks at a speed of 500m per hour. The duration of the stroll is <b>4 hours</b>.
<li>There is a chance of meeting another Murasaki-san who has chosen <b>the same destination and companion</b>. When Murasaki-san meets many friends during the stroll, they become happy and <b>get bonus on the strolling distance</b>.
<li>When the total strolling distance or total number of friends reach a certain level, Murasaki-san may <b>discover a random <a href="items.html#twinkle">twinkle NFT</a></b>.
</ul>

<p>
This mechanism was implemented not to speed up gameplay, but because the developers simply wanted to let Murasaki-san play outside of the house. Murasaki-san, who takes a leisurely walk with their favorite drink and companion, seems very happy :)

<!---### practice --->
<details><summary>Practicing<img src="src/icon/item_piano.png" width="32" height="32" class="textMiddle"></summary>

<p>
By crafting at least one musical instrument, Murasaki-san will be able to <b>start practicing instruments</b>.
</p>

&nbsp;<img src="src/png/item_clarinet.png" width="72" height="72">
&nbsp;<img src="src/png/item_piano.png" width="72" height="72">
&nbsp;<img src="src/png/item_violin.png" width="72" height="72">


<p>
At the beginning of practice, the player can choose one instrument out of three (piano, violin, clarinet) to start practicing. Mastery levels accumulate for each instrument. <b>The higher the rarity of the instrument used for practice, and the higher the parameters associated with the instrument (STR for clarinet, DEX for piano, INT for violin)</b>, the faster the mastery level will increase.
</p>

<p>
The Mastery levels, listed in ascending order of proficiency, are as follows: <font color="#999999"><b>Inexperienced</font></b>, <font color="#228b22"><b>Beginner</font></b>, <font color="#006400"><b>Talented</font></b>, <font color="#0000ff"><b>Skilled</font></b>, <font color="#000080"><b>Intermediate</font></b>, <font color="#ff8c00"><b>Skillful</font></b>, <font color="#d2691e"><b>Seasoned</font></b>, <font color="#ff0000"><b>Proficient</font></b>, <font color="#ff00ff"><b>Advanced</font></b>, <font color="#8a2be2"><b>Expert</font></b>, and <font color="#800080"><b>Master</font></b>.
</p>

<p>
When Murasaki-san starts practicing an instrument, their three pets and fluffies will gather around and join the practice together. Murasaki-san seems to love singing and playing music.
</p>

<p>
The practice system has been designed as <b>a kind of endgame content</b>. Currently, increasing mastery level does not have any particular effect on the gameplay. Additionally, since mastery level increases very slowly, it requires a considerable amount of practice time to reach the maximum level. In the future, the developer would like to implement concerts and performances for Murasaki-san with their own favorite instrument, but this is still in the conceptual stage at the moment :)

<!-- gas cost -->

<details>
<summary>Gas Cost &#x26FD;</summary>

<p>
Since all computations and data storage are conducted on-chain in this project, developers consider the gas fees paid by players to be crucial for gameplay. 
</p>

<p>
With the implementation of <a href="https://docs.astar.network/docs/learn/tokenomics2/">Astar Tokenomics 2.0</a> at the end of 2023, the gas fees on the Astar EVM saw a significant increase. Since the implementation of Tokenomics 2.0, efforts have been made to refactor and minimize the gas fees required for executing each contract, but unfortunately, a certain level of cost remains necessary.
</p>

<p>
Currently, for standard gameplay, approximately <b>0.8-1.0 $ASTR</b> of gas fees per day are required.
</p>

<p>
<b>The use of the daycare service:</b> To alleviate the stress of gas costs for players, a daycare service allowing batch transactions has been provided. By utilizing this daycare service, players can continue basic gameplay for around <b>0.4 $ASTR</b> per day (only Feeding and Grooming). However, receiving care through the daycare service means critical checks by LUK are not conducted, and the experience gained is reduced to 80%. Therefore, the growth of the player's character, murasaki-san, is slower compared to when caring for themselves. While caring for oneself may incur higher gas costs than using the daycare service, it guarantees 100% of the experience gained and, additionally, there is a possibility of doubling the experience gained if a critical check by LUK is successful.
</p>

<p>
Developers are actively seeking ways to reduce gas fees and continuing their efforts to generate profits exceeding the gas fees paid by players.
</p>

</details>


<!---### contracts --->

<details>
<summary>Contracts &#x1f4cb;</summary>
<p>
The project is currently implemented as a complex set of 31 contracts consisting of one NFT contract, two SBT contracts, six storage contracts, seven function contracts, and several add-on contracts.
</p>

<p>
Here is an overview of each contract:
</p>

<p class="lineHeight8">
<img width="700" src="src/png/fig_contracts.png" />
<font size="-2">
<b>Abbreviations:</b> mfs:Murasaki_Function_Share, mfcc:Murasaki_Function_Crafting_Codex, ma:Murasaki_Address, mp:Murasaki_Parameter, mffg:Murasaki_Function_Feeding_and_Grooming, mfmf:Murasaki_Function_Mining_and_Farming, mfsl:Murasaki_Function_Summon_and_Levelup, mmp:Murasaki_Music_Practice, mfc1:Murasaki_Function_Crafting1, mfc2:Murasaki_Function_Crafting2, mfn:Murasaki_Function_name, mss:Murasaki_Storage_Score, ms:Murasaki_Storage, msn:Murasaki_Storage_Nui, mse:Murasaki_Storage_Extra, mm:Murasaki_Main, mc:Murasaki_Craft, mn:Murasaki_Name, market:Murasaki_Market_Item, mav:Murasaki_Achievement, uri:Murasaki_tokenURI, mml:Murasaki_Mail, md:Murasaki_Dice, mst:Murasaki_Staking, ll:Murasaki_Lootlike, ff:Fluffy_Festival, st:Strolling, info:Murasaki_Info, Murasaki:Murasakisan
</font>
</p>

<p>
The solidity code for each contract can be referenced <a href="https://github.com/degupoppo/murasaki-san/tree/main/contracts">on the github repository</a>. The latest address of each contract is storaged in the <a href="https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0x176C5B3582C8C851B7aF4efac618fb17901cDDf1">Murasaki_Address</a> contract.
</p>

<p>
All contracts are linked and managed through the summoner ID assigned to the Murasaki-san SBT.
Function contracts are individually replaceable, and bug fixes, balance adjustments, and other game upgrades can be implemented by replacing or updating them. Add-on contracts are created as needed when adding new features for the gameplay.
</p>

<p>
Due to the complexity of the project's contract system, a viewer contract has been prepared to provide convenient access to major parameters of Murasaki-san. The viewer contract follows the concept of web3 and is available for anyone to use without any permissions. It is also designed to be referenced in the future endeavors, such as the upcomming next product that the developers plan to create using WASM. For more detailed information about the viewer contract, please refer to the "<a href="#developer">For the Developers</a>" session.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security:</b> All contracts inherit ReentrancyGuard, Ownable, and Pausable from Openzeppelin. Almost all functions that players can execute require them to possess active Murasaki-san SBT in their wallet. Developers can quickly remove clearly harmful players such as botters and crackers from the community by deactivating their SBTs. Contracts that serve logical functions are replaceable and can be partially replaced to fix bugs or adjust gamebalances flexibly. Only two contracts hold token assets: BufferVault and BuybackTreasury. BufferVault has no functions that can be executed by someone other than the contract owner. BubackTreasury has a function that players can execute, but it has nonReentrant modifier and a transfer limit, making it impossible to exploit a bug to extract assets from the Treasury. Developers continuously monitor all contract activity and immediately remove any clearly harmful players.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ownership:</b> All parameters and status of NFTs and SBTs in this project are recorded on Astar chain. Some solidity codes, which are only allowed to be used by the contract owner, have a mechanism that can be used to rewrite user states, but at this time the developers believe it is necessary for game balance adjustment, bug fixes, contract upgrades, and preventing botting. After this product is sufficiently stable, the developers plan to gradually renounce ownership of each contract.

<!---### buyback --->

<details id="buyback">

<summary>Buyback Treasury &#x1f4b5;</summary>

<center>
<p class="notice" style="width:80%;">
<b>&#127775; Attention &#127775;</b><br>
The contents described below are applicable if this project is adopted for dApp Staking on the Astar Network
</p>
</center>

<p>
The buyback system was designed to ensure that players can sell the NFTs of this project to the treasury at a fixed price at any time, thereby <b>consistently guaranteeing the asset value of the NFTs</b> in this project. The buyback prices never decrease but always slightly increase over time. The developers aim to achieve <b>a "trustless" price increase of NFTs</b> through this mechanism.
</p>

<p>
The developers believe that continuing to play the game solely for monetary gain can be somewhat burdensome. Lucky players may be able to sell their earned NFTs at a high price and make some profits. However, this can create temporary and sometimes harmful bubbles, disadvantaging unlucky players or latecomers.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the developers also understand the enjoyment of having NFTs with asset value.
</p>

<p>
To improve on this goal, the developers have implemented an automated buyback system in this project. Approximately half of the starting fee paid by the player is immediately sent to the buyback treasury. Players can receive a fixed-price buyback at any time by burning the NFTs of this project. Item NFTs that require more resources to craft in the game are assigned higher buyback prices. Additionally, the buyback prices set for each item gradually increase over time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Buyback price calculation:</b><br>
<font size="-0.5">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price = Resource / 1074560 * AmountPerPlayer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resouce = [The sum of coins and leaves required for crafting]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AmountPerPlayer = [Set at 45% of the starting price and increasing]
</font>
</p>

<p>
In other words, the minimum price of each NFTs in this project is determined, and this minimum price (buyback price) <b>never decreases but always increase</b> over time. With each acquisition of NFTs through ongoing gameplay, the player's asset value increases steadily, and it also continues to increase by holding the NFTs. Since the buyback treasury always holds enough to buyback all items from all players, there will never be a situation where the reasury runs out and later players cannot receive buybacks.
</p>

In general, the price of NFTs is believed to be determined by trus in the project developers, which can be summarized based on factors such as the project's popularity, anticipation, and the assurance that developers will continue their development and economic activities. We have considered whether trust in the project canbe implemented "trustlessly" through a buyback system. In other words, the buyback system, governed by rules implemented in a smart contract, ensures that the price of NFTs continues to rise consistently, regardless of the size of public perception.

</figcaption>
</center>
</p>

<p>
Regarding the rate of increase in the buyback price, developers plan to tradually raise it, but developers don't have specific calculations for the appropriate rate of increase at the moment. The buyback price will increase faster as additional funds flow into this project (see the Economy Details session). As an example, developers are considering a rate of increase of approximately 1-3% per month. Additionally, if there are many dropout players who have stopped playing the game, the buyback prices for players who continue to play will be more likely to increase (the buyback tokens allocated for dropout players will be reallocated to the remaining players). On the other hand, interestingly, a large influx of new players is expected to make it difficult to increase the buyback price (as the increase of the buyback price is equivalent to the new inflow value divided by the total active players).
</p>

<p>
It is unknow how much the Buyback Price can be increased, so please do not have excessive expectations. This system does not guarantee the so-called play2earn, but guarantee a minimum monetary value so that players can enjoy the gameplay leisurely in the medium to long term.
</p>

<p>
Of course, all players have the option to sell NFTs on the marketplace insted of burning them in the buyback system. It is likely that players can sell NFTs at higher prices on the marketplace compared to buyback price. The buyback system can be seen as a defensive mechanism to prevent the price of NFTs from plummeting in case there are no buyers.
</p>

<p>
This buyback system is somewhat experimental, and its acceptance by players will only be known after it has been operational for a while. The developers will continuously explore areas for improvement.

<b>&#127775; Attention &#127775;</b><br>
The contents described below are applicable if this project is adopted for dApp Staking on the Astar Network
</p>
</center>

<p>
Through the Buyback Sysmte and following economic strategies, the developers aim to create a low-stress economic system in the medium to long term. Our goal is to create a system where players can enjoy the gameplay for a longer period without the stress of incurring significant losses in the short term. Our focus is on fostering a relaxed and enjoyable experience over an extended period, rather than seeking quick and substantial profits. We aim to realize the above ecosystem not through expectations or trust in the project, but rather as "trustless" rules defined by contracts.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Notice:</b> In this project, the asset value is considered on an $ASTR basis rather than in US dollar basis.</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Sustainable Economy:</b> In this project, our goal is to establish a sustainable economic model where the value of assets (NFTs) gradually and steadily increases. While it's beneficial to have a consistent influx of new players and sustained interest in purchasing NFTs, we acknowledge the challenges of maintaining long-term sustainability. Our primary focus is on preserving the asset value of active players by Buyback Treasury System. We do not require players to continuously buy tokens or NFTs as a means to support the project's asset value. Instead, the overall asset value of the project (equal to Buyback Price) is supported by the rewards generated through dApp Staking, where players stake their assets. The majority of dApp staking rewards (90%) will be used to inflate the Buyback Treasury, ensuring NFT values and increasing future rewards through self-staking. In this model, the generation of funds is not reliant on new player influx but rather on the dApp Staking activities of active players. In other words, even if the number of active players decreases, the asset value per active player does not diminish.
</p>

<p>
<b>Monetary Incentives for Continued Gameplay:</b> As one of our objectives, we believe it's essential for players to not only enjoy continuous gameplay but also experience a tangible increase in the value of their in-game assets. The majority of NFTs in this project are designed to enhance gameplay efficiency when owned in the player's wallet. Additionally, the minting of new NFTs is only possible through ongoing and efficient gameplay. Furthermore, the buyback price, which determines the value of NFTs, gradually and steadily increases over time. This means that players who engage in more consistent gameplay and own a larger number of NFTs will have their future asset value guaranteed to grow. Players may sell their NFTs in the marketplace or burn them in the buyback treasury, but doing so will reduce their game efficiency and decrease the future value of their assets. From a financial incentive perspective, it is most rational to continue to own many NFTs and maintain efficient gameplay. We hope that these models serve as motivation for players to engage in continuous gameplay.
</p>

<p>
<b>Mitigating the Ponzi Scheme Effect:</b> Here, the term "Ponzi scheme" refers to a situation where latecomers are heavily exploited by early adopters due to excessively powerful early bird advantages (deviating slightly from the original meaning of a Ponzi scheme). While early bird advantages are not inherently negative, we believe that if they are too strong, the number of players who suffer disadvantages increases. In this project, the influx of new players does not increase the buyback price, nor does it increase or decrease the allocated asset value per player. The inflation of the buyback price is solely driven by the funding indicated by the blue arrows within the figure, representing the inflow of funds from the Buffer Vault. The red arrows, representing the inflow of funds from new players, increase the total assets of the buyback treasury but do not affect the buyback price. In this project, the increase in active players' monetary value is not driven by the influx of new players but mainly by the game fee and dApp Staking reword (the yellow arrows).
</p>

<p>
Here is an overview of the token flow:<br>
<center>
<img width="650" src="src/png/fig_economy_2.png" />
<figcaption>
<sup>1)</sup>Extra Fees: petrification cure fees and direct item transfer fees.
</figcaption>
</center>
</p>

<b>Starting Fee:</b> 45% of it is sent to the buyback treasury as the initial capital. However, the buyback price remains unchanged. 45% is sent to the staking treasury and self-staked in dApp staking to generate income for future inflation of the buyback treasury. The remaining 10% is sent to developers. This processes are automatically performed by smart contracts on the blockchain.


<p>
<b>Buyback Price Inflation<sup>2)</sup>:</b> All dApp staking rewards and in-game fees are collected in the Buffer Vault. The funds necessary to increase the total assets of the Buyback Treasury, for example, by 3% per month, are transferred to the Buyback Treasury (X%). The remaining funds are sent to the Staking Treasury to increase the self-staking amount (Y%). 10% is allocated to developers. The appropriate inflation rate, currently planned to be around 3% per month, will be adjusted periodically based on the number of active users and dApp staking volume. This process is automatically executed by smart contracts on the blockchain, but the timing of when the process is carried out is determined manually by the developer.
</p>

<p>
<b>Self Staking:</b> After Buyback Price Inflating, any remaining funds are moved to the Staking Treasury (EOA) and self-staked in dApp Staking. Self-staking is a mechanism to secure funds for future inflation of the Buyback Price. The amount of tokens in the self-staking wallet will essentially increase over time, and this balance is also intended to be used as the treasury for the next season. Developers aim to achieve sufficient inflation rates through only new fund inflows into the project, but will consider supplementing from the self-staking wallet if necessary. These processes are currently done manually as there is no way to automate them, but they are planned to be automated in the future.
</p>

<p>
<b>Inflation Rate:</b> The inflation rate of Buyback Price depends on the amount of capital inflow per active player. As the dApp Staking amount per active player increases, it creates inflationary pressure. On the other hand, a large influx of new players is expected to decrease the dApp Staking amount per active player, which inhibit inflation. Conversely, an increase in dropout players results in the reallocation of tokens previously allocated to dropout players to the current active players, creating inflationary pressure. In other words, an increase in new players does not affect the current asset value of active players, and a decrease in active players increases the future asset value of remaining players, providing an incentive for continuous gameplay.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the expansion of the Buyback Treasury, which secures the overall value of the project, is determined by the amount of dApp Staking per active player. Only self-staking with a starting fee of 45% is unlikely to achieve an attractive inflation rate, and the voluntary participation of each player in dApp Staking is required. The developers are committed to actively encouraging players to participate in dApp Staking through ongoing development efforts.
</p>

<p>
<center>
<img width="500" src="src/png/fig_inflation.png" />
<figcaption>
Projected graph of acceptable inflation rate and buyback price (NFT price) based on dApp Staking amount per active player. The dApp Staking Reward was assumed to be APR 11% and the calculation was made under the assumption that the number of active players and dApp Staking amount remain constant for a period of 2 years. For example, if the average staking amount of all active players is 7,000 $ASTR, the buyback price of each NFT is expected to increase by approximately five times after two years. Furthermore, the rate of increase in the buyback price does not depend on the number of active players. Note that this calculation is based on a simplified model and Astar Tokenomics 1.0. In Astar Tokenomics 2.0 and dApp Staking V3, there may be different potential outcomes in the calculatins. IR: monthly inflation rate, ST: staking amount per active player.
</figcaption>
</center>
</p>

<p>
<b>Capital Recovery Strategy:</b> In this project, the buyback price has been adjusted to achieve a balance where the initial fee can be recovered in approximately two years of play by burning all 48 craftable items, assuming a 3% monthly inflation rate in the buyback price (This is attainable through dApp staking at abount 1000 $ASTR per active player at Astar Tokenomics 1.0). If the monthly buyback price inflation exceeds 3%, the recovery amount after two years will be higher; conversely, if the inflation is lower, the recovery amount will be less. The inflation of the buyback price is expected to increase with rising dApp Staking rewards and an increase in dropout players (those who become inactive). It is anticipated that recovering the initial investment using the buyback mechanism will become challenging if continuous play is discontinued before the two-year mark. Therefore, in this project, early entry and early exit are not considered effective capital recovery strategies, and long-term and continuous play is regarded as a rational capital recovery strategy.

<!--- Astar --->

<h3 id="astar">Why Astar? <img src="src/png/coin_color_ASTR.png" width="32" height="32"></h3>

<p>
Astar is a highly promising and excellent blockchain. The developers have chosen Astar as the launch platform for this project primarily for the following reasons:
</p>

<p>
<b>dApp Staking:</b><br>
The developers can focus on the project's development without worrying about financial sustainability, if their project were adopted for dApp staking. On the player's side, they can support the project financially without exposing their assets to hacking risks or depleting them by excessive purchases of the project's NFTs or tokens. In this project, players engaging in dApp staking are rewarded with in-game incentives, allowing both the project and players to benefit from low-risk profit. In other words, players who are fond of this project and want to play more efficiently have an incentive to stake more assets in dApp staking. This incentivizes the project's developers strive to make development that encourage players to stake more funds in dApp staking. To our knowledge, Astar Network is the first to advocate for this excellent mechanism.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cross-Virtual Machine (XVM):</b><br>
By utilizing XVM, the developers will have the freedom to seamlessly interoperate between EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) contracts and WASM (WebAssembly) contracts, allowing for future compatibility. Currently, EVM benefits from excellent libraries and development knowledge. However, in the near future, within a few years, WASM is expected to become a core technology in Web3. The developers believe that Astar chain, with the availability of XVM, is the only platform that enables a seamless shift of development resources from EVM to WASM. One of our main goals is to constantly keep up with the latest technologies in web3. For our next season project, the developers aim to leverage the assets of this EVM-based project while developing on a WASM basis, and Astar Network is the only platform that allows for such development possibilities.
</p>

<p>
<b>Low Gas Fee:</b><br>
When developing a fully on-chain game, the low cost of gas fee is extremely important. Currently, Astar chain maintains very low gas fees, allowing players to engage in gameplay with minimal concerns about gas costs, even for transactions involving relatively complex operations. Additionally, this project requires over 100 transactions for contract deployment and setup, so having low gas fees is greatly appreciated by the developers as well.
</p>

<p>
<b>Top of the Polkadot Parachains:</b><br>
We strongly believe in the future interoperability brought by Polkadot and parachains. Based on the three reasons mentioned above, the developers are confident that Astar Network is currently the most suitable environment for project development among the parachains of Polkadot.
</p>

<p>
<b>Substrate EVM or L2 EVM:</b><br>
When developing an on-chain project using Solidity, there are two options currently available on Astar Network: using the Substrate EVM or using Soneium (Ethereum L2). We have chosen the Substrate EVM as the development environment for this project due to its compatibility with dApp Staking, strong integration with WASM, and sustainability of blockchain. We are more interested in steadily and enjoyably developing this project over the long term rather than riding a transient momentum. We believe that the Astar Substrate EVM and WASM environment are the most suitable development environment for our motivations.
</p>

<p>
Cheers to Astar :)

<!--- Future Plan --->

<h3 id="future">Future Plan &#9203;</h3>

<p>
<b>After Launching:</b>
</p>

<p>
House of Murasaki-san, the first season of this project, is nearly complete, so there are no major feature additions planned for the future. Additionally, since this project is a full-on-chain dApp created with contracts and a static html, there are no online servers that developers need to maintain. Game processing in response to player actions is all automatically handled on-chain.
</p>

<p>
The only interventions developers need to make involve setting the buyback price inflation rate and updating prices. If other adjustments like bug fixes or game balance changes become necessary, developers will upgrade the relevant contracts as needed. Developers will also work on frontend adjustments for UI/UX improvements.
</p>

<p>
After the launch of this project, developers will primarily engage in the following activities.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixing bugs.
<li>Improving UI/UX details of front-end.
<li>Controling inflation rate of the buyback system.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Next Season:</b>
</p>

<p>
The project will move to the next season in a couple of years.<br>
</p>

<p>
It takes at least about <b>two years</b> for House of Murasaki-san to reach maximum growth. Over this two years, the developers plan to create the next product which uses the information of <a href="#developer">the Murasakisan contract</a> descrived above.
</p>

<p>
The concept of the next product is still undecided yet, but we would like to make a work related to the travel or the journey. Actually, the last items Murasaki-san can craft are related to travel.
</p>

<p>
One day, a grown your Murasaki-san may set off on a journey with their friends from your house :)
