<!--- What's This? --->

<h3 id="whats_this">What's This? &#127808;</h3>
<p>
House of Murasaki-san project is a dApp game built on Astar Network.<br>
You can summon your Murasaki-san character and care them to grow.<br>
</p>
<p>
You can <b><a href="house.html?summoner=1">Demo Preview</a></b> before summoning your Murasaki-san.<br>
(Developer's character. No transactions are permitted except for Feeding.) <br>
</p>

<details><summary>What's the Murasaki-san...?</summary>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, when I asked a friend to "create an original character that doesn't exist anywhere else", Murasaki-san was born on the edge of our sketchbook. Well, we all know that the name, murasaki-san, is a bit strange; murasaki-san means "Mr. Purple" in Japanese. My friend first painted this little character purple so we could only call it murasaki-san and we finally ended up naming it "Murasaki-san", even though it's actually a little pink ;)<br>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's why I started creating on a game to move, take care of, and grow Murasaki-san. It was just two weeks after the Astar Network launched and we wanted to build something fun on Astar chain. After about a year of development period, we are happy to launch House of Murasaki-san on the Astar Network :)<br>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheers to Astar and Murasaki-san.<br>

<!--- Concept --->

<h3 id="concept">The Main Concept &#127799;</h3>
<p><b><font color="blue">--- Under construction ---</font></b></p>
<p>
Murasaki-san is the digital pet living in your wallet.<br>
Murasaki-san and the house...time is the most important cost, and slow and long.
</p>


<!--- How to --->

<h3 id="howto">How to Play &#128216;</h3>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Mint</b> your murasaki-san (it's <b>SBT</b>, not NFT).<br>
<li><b>Feeding</b> and <b>Grooming</b> your murasaki-san to ean EXP.<br>
<li>You can <b>Level up</b> your murasaki-san by accumulating EXP.<br>
<li>Work your murasaki-san for <b>Mining</b> to earn Coin or <b>Farming</b> to earn Leaf.<br>
<li>Murasaki-san can <b>Crafting</b> to mint item NFT by paying Coin or Leaf.<br>
<li>If you want, item NFTs can be bought and sold on the <b>Marketplace</b> using $ASTR.<br>
<li>House of murasaki-san will become more and more lively as you continue to take care of your murasaki-san diligently.<br><br>
</ul></p>

  <img alt="Game screen" src="src/png/demo.jpg" />
  <figcaption>Game screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<b>Attention:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not forget to <u>Feed twice a day</u> and <u>Groom once every three days</u>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time is the most important resouce.<br>
</p>


<!--- Cost --->

<h3 id="cost">Cost to Play &#x1f4b0;</h3>
<p>
Mint Price: <b>200 $ASTR <img src="src/png/coin_color_ASTR.png" width="24" height="24"></b><br>
</p>

<p>
The mint price will inflate little by little as the game economy expands.<br>
(Expected example: 3% inflation after a month, 206 $ASTR)<br>
</p>

<p>
Basically, there are no billing systems requiring additional costs that affect gameplay, except for the Dapps Staking Bonuses (see below). If you buy or sell item NFTs on the Marketplace, some $ASTR will be needed.
</p>

<!--- Attention --->

<h3 id="attention">Attentions &#x2757;&#x2757;</h3>
<p><ul>
<li>Murasaki-san is an <b>SBT</b>, not an NFT, so <b>it cannot be transferred or sold.</b><br>
On the other hand, you can buy and sell crafted item NFTs.
<li>If you neglect to take care of your Murasaki-san for a long time (<b>about a month</b>), Murasaki-san will become petrified, and you will need some <b>additional cost</b> to cure.
<li><b>Botting play using multi-wallets is profibited</b>. You will be penalized for violating the anti-bot policy.
</ul>
</p>


<!--- Staking Bonus --->

<h3 id="staking">Dapps Staking Bonus! &#x1f973;</h3>
<p><b><font color="blue">--- We have not applied for Builder's Program yet ---<br>
--- These bonuses might be active in the future ---</font></b></p>
<font color="darkgray">
<p>
There are <b>in-game bonuses</b> depending on your dapps staking amount for this project.<br>
<ul>
<li>Get an <b>extra presentbox</b> every interval period.<br>
The higher the staking amount, the shorter the interval until the gift.<br>
<li>Some items <b>change the picture or animation</b> according to your staking amount.<br>
Observe carefully, or spoiled below.<br>
</ul></p>
</font>


<!--- Market --->

<h3 id="market">Item Marketplace &#x1f30f;</h3>
<p>
Item NFTs can be bought and sold on the <b><a href="market.html">Marketplace</a></b> with 5% royalty fee.<br>
We have not own token and <b>$ASTR</b> is used as the trading currency.<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Attention:</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only wallets with an active Murasaki-san SBT can use the Marketplace.
</p>


<!--- Hints --->

<h3 id="hint">Hints &#x1f4ac;</h3>
<p><ul>
    <li>At the level-up, status point of Murasaki-san will increase depending to behavier. Ex: if you spent more time for mining, the more strength will increase.</li>
    <li>The exp gained by grooming depends on not-working time. It means that if you did not make your Murasaki-san work, grooming will give a lot of exp to faster level-up.</li>
    <li>If you leave your Murasaki-san for a long long time (about a month), Murasaki-san will be petrified with deeply disappointment. Once petrified, your Murasaki-san can not do anything. For incentives of dedication, we have set some cost for cure petrification.<br><b>CAUTION: To cure petrification, you need Lv x 10 $ASTR cost</b>.
    <li>
        If you know friend's Murasaki-san ID, you can visit his/her house. <br>
        You can do feeding other player's Murasaki-san to earn a little extra exp.<br>
        Murasaki-san ID:&nbsp;
        <input type="number" id="summoner" style="width:100px;">&nbsp;
        <button onclick="button_select_summoner();">Visit House</button>

<!--- Earn --->

<h3 id="earn">Play to Earn...? &#x1fa99;</h3>

<p><b><font color="blue">--- We have not applied for Builder's Program yet ---<br>
--- The strategy of Buyback system could be changed ---</font></b></p>
<font color="darkgray">

<p>
<b>Don't expect too much.<br></b>
We will NOT issue our own tokens that can be pumped and dumped.
</p>

<p>
Based on market principles, item NFT may or may not be priced high. Sometimes it may sell for a high price on the marketplace. But we think these are always temporary.
</p>
<p>
We think playing games only to earn money is kind of a pain. But we also understand it is fun to realize that the NFTs you own have some value.
</p>
<p>
To improve on this goal, we have devised a buyback system. Half of the mint cost is immediately sent to the buyback vault, which buys item NFTs for a fixed amount at any time. This minimum price is by no means a high amount, but will never fall, and will rise little by little as the game economy expands.
</p>
<p>
It may be difficult to make money using the Buyback System, but it will prove that the NFTs we have are not worthless.
</p>
</font>


<!--- Future Plan --->

<h3 id="future">Future Plan &#9203;</h3>
<p>
<b>Just after launch:</b><br>
Our priority is to control inflation rate and keep the game going.<br>
<ul>
<li>Fixing bags.
<li>Improving UI details.
<li>Correcting typo and misspelling.
<li>Controling inflation of buyback system.
</ul></p>
<p>
We would be happy if a lot of people played the game, but it would also be nice if there were  a few dedicated enthusiasts, so we does not plan to do any excessive marketing.
</p>
<p>
<b>After that:</b><br>
It takes about <b>two years</b> for House of Murasaki-san to reach maximum growth. Over this two years, we plan to create the next product which uses the statuses of our Murasaki-san. Since Astar Network supports both EVM and WASM, so we plan to use Rust to create our next product on WASM, and interacting with House of Murasaki-san via XCM (Well, the coder is enjoying learning Rust now and is interested in <a href="https://bevyengine.org/">Bevy framework</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>
The concept of the next product is still undecided well, but we would like to make a work related to travel (actually, the last items Murasaki-san can craft are related to travel).
</p>
<p>
One day, a grown your Murasaki-san may set off on a journey with their friends.
</p>


<!--- Developer --->

<h3 id="developer">For the Developers &#x1f527;</h3>
<p>
We prepared <a href="">the contract</a> to refer to the information of Murasaki-san. Using this contract, you can get the status values of specific Murasaki-san from the wallet address such as Level, Age, Name, STR, DEX, present satiety, score, total_exp_gained, total_item_crafted, and so on.<br>
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Contract Address: XXX<br>
<li>Contract ABI: XXX<br>
<li>Contract interface in Solidity: YYY<br>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This contract allows you to use Murasaki-san information linked to a specific wallet in your web pages and contracts (ex: display the Murasaki-san Name and Level from the connected wallet in your Web page, etc.). 
</p>
<p>
Please feel free to use.
